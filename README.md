# Advent of Code 2025

Welcome to my [**Advent of Code 2025**](https://adventofcode.com/2025/) repository! This repository contains a set of coding challenges, each organized into its own folder. Each challenge is structured with a problem description, an input file, and (typically) a Python solution, but this year I might mix things up a little, and perhaps solve some challenges in other languages, or even in multiple languages. (Provided, I become a time billionaire)

For more information about the Advent of Code and the challenges for the year 2025, visit [the official website](https://adventofcode.com)!
Challenges for the previous years can be found under [the Events page](https://adventofcode.com/events).

## 🏆 Challenges

Each day (D1 to D12) presents a new coding challenge. The problems may involve algorithms, data structures, or other programming concepts.

## 🚀 Running the Solutions

To run a solution for a specific day's challenge:

1. Navigate to the challenge folder, e.g., `D1`.
2. Ensure `input.txt` contains the required input data. Input data is different for everyone, so if you want to solve your own challenge, please replace the contents with your input data.
3. Run the script or executable with the appropriate runtime/interpreter, etc. (Make sure, you have the proper tools, e.g. Python or Node.js installed)

```bash
# Python
python main.py

# JavaScript
node index.js
```

## 📂 Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders by day:

- Day 1: Secret Entrance \[[Task](./D1/task.md) | [Example input](./D1/example-input.txt) | [Solution](./D1/main.py) | [Web](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/1)\]
